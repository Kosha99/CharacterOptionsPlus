Arrowsong minstrels are also proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). An arrowsong minstrel can cast bard spells while wearing light armor and using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, An arrowsong minstrel wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass arrowsong minstrel still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes."

The spells selected must not already be on the bard spell list, and must be 6th level or lower. At 4th level and every 4 bard levels thereafter, she adds an additional sorcerer/wizard spell to her bard spell list. An Arrowsong minstrel is limited to the following spells when adding spells to her spell list in this manner: acid arrow, arrow eruption, flame arrow, gravity bow, greater magic weapon, longshot, magic weapon, protection from arrows, spectral hand, true strike, and sorcerer/wizard spells of the evocation school. An Arrowsong minstrel must still select these spells as spells known before she can cast them.\n\nIn addition, for the purpose of meeting the requirements of combat feats and prestige classes, an Arrowsong minstrel treats her bard level as her base attack bonus (in addition to base attack bonuses gained from other classes and Hit Dice)."
